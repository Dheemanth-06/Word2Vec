# Word2Vec
# Word2Vec Demo

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the use of Word2Vec for word embeddings.

## Features
- Prepares a small text corpus and tokenizes it
- Trains a Word2Vec model on sample data
- Visualizes word embeddings in n-dimensional space
- Loads a pre-trained Google News Word2Vec model
- Trains a custom Word2Vec model

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- gensim
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
